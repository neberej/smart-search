    "full_text": "Drylab Newsfor investors & friends \u00b7 May 2 017\nWelcome to our first newsletter of 2017! It's\nbeen a while since the last one, and a lot has\nhappened. W e promise to k eep them coming\nevery two months hereafter , and permit\nourselv es to mak e this one r ather long. The\nbig news is the beginnings of our launch in\nthe American mark et, but there are also\ninteresting updates on sales, de velopment,\nmentors and ( of course ) the in vestment\nround that closed in January .\nNew capital: The in vestment round was\nsuccessful. W e raised 2.13 MNOK to matchthe 2.05 MNOK loan from Inno vation\nNorwa y. Including the de velopment\nagreement with Filmlance International, the\ntotal new capital is 5 MNOK, partly tied to\nthe successful completion of milestones. All\nformalities associated with this process are\nnow finalized.\nNew owners: We would especially lik e to\nwarmly welcome our new owners to the\nDrylab family: Unni Jacobsen, T orstein Jahr ,\nSuzanne Bolstad, Eivind Bergene, T urid Brun,\nVigdis T rondsen, L ea Blindheim, Kristine\n34meetingsmeetings\nNY \u00b7 SFNY \u00b7 SF\nLA \u00b7 LLA \u00b7 L VVAcadem y of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  \u00b7 Alesha & Jamie Metzger  \u00b7 Amazon\nAWS  \u00b7 Apple  \u00b7 Caitlin Burns, PGA  \u00b7 Carlos Melcer  \u00b7 Chimne y L.A. \u00b7 Dado V alentic  \u00b7\nDave Stump  \u00b7 DIT WIT  \u00b7 ERA NY C \u00b7 Facebook  \u00b7 Fancy Film  \u00b7 FilmLight  \u00b7 Geo Labelle  \u00b7\nGoogle  \u00b7 IBM  \u00b7 Inno vation Norwa y (NY C) \u00b7 Inno vation Norwa y (SF)  \u00b7 International\nCinematogr aphers Guild  \u00b7 NBC  \u00b7 Local 871  \u00b7 Netflix  \u00b7 Pomfort  \u00b7 Radiant Images  \u00b7\nScreening Room  \u00b7 Signiant  \u00b7 Moods of Norwa y \u00b7 Tapad  \u00b7 Team Downe y\nHolmsen, T orstein Hansen, and Jostein\nAanensen. W e look forward to working with\nyou!\nSales: Return customer r ate is now 80%,\npro ving value and willingness to pa y. Film\nFactory Montreal is our first customer in\nCanada. Lumiere Numeriques ha ve started\nusing us in F rance. W e also ha ve new\ncustomers in Norwa y, and high-profile users\nsuch as Gareth Un win, producer of Oscar-\nwinning The King's Speech . Re venue for the\nfirst four months is 200 kNOK, compared to\n339 kNOK for all of 2016. W e are working\non a partnership to safeguard sales in\nNorwa y while beginning to focus more on\nthe US.\nNew team members: We've extended our\norganization with two permanent de velopers\nbased in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, the film capital of P oland. T wo\nhighly skilled interns from the Univ ersity of\nOslo 's Entrepreneurship Progr am, will be\nworking on mark et research until mid-June\n(starting in March), preparing for the US\nlaunch. Also, two computer science students\nare working as part-time interns during\nspring, on machine learning and analysis\nresearch, as well as inno vativ e architectures\nbased on the Swift language. W e hope our\ninterns will consider sticking around!\nNew mentor: We are honored to ha ve\nCaitlin Burns joining us as a mentor . She 's anaccomplished producer based in New Y ork,\nan activ e member of the Producers Guild of\nAmerica, and the collabor ation has already\nyielded good results, including valuable\ncontacts for our visit in L os Angeles. Oscar-\nwinning VFX supervisor Dave Stump joined\nus earlier .\nNew York, St. Louis, San Francisco and\nLos Angeles: Pontus and Audun did a tour\nof the US in F ebruary and March, meeting\nusers, partners and potential customers. The\ntrip was v ery successful, with se veral high\npoints, including meetings with Netflix, the\nAcadem y of Motion Picture Arts and\nSciences, the International\nCinematogr aphers Guild, L ocal 871 (the\nscript supervisors' union), one of the world's\nleading DIT s, and Apple. See the separ ate\nattachment for a more detailed summary .\nNAB: Andreas and Audun tr avelled to the\nNational Association of Broadcasters\ncon vention (NAB) in Las V egas for three\nhectic da ys in April. NAB gathers 100,000\nparticipants from film and TV . It's a v ery\nefficient wa y of meeting people in the\nbusiness, and getting an updated picture of\nthe business landscape. The most e xciting\nmeeting was with PIX System, one of our\nmost important competitors. It was\ninteresting to note that the y regarded the\nindie mark et as bigger than their own.\nAndreas was able to secure us an\ninvitation to the DIT -WIT party , with some of\nthe world's leading DIT s in attendance. It was\na great place for informal feedback on Drylab\nViewer . The pattern was the same as for\nother users: Initial polite interest turns to\nreal enthusiasm the moment someone is able\nto personally try Drylab Viewer! W e also\nmet with P omfort and Apple about our on-\ngoing collabor ations; ARRI and T eradek/\nParalinx about camer a integr ation; Amazon,\nGoogle and IBM about cloud computing.\nWWDC and Silicon Valley: We were v ery\npleasantly surprised to be in vited b y Apple to\ntheir W orld Wide De velopers Conference in\nSan Jose in June, despite not ha ving applied.\nIt's a valuable chance to learn and mak e new\nconnections. W e\u2019re also setting aside time to\nmeet other potential partners.\nCine Gear: We ha ve decided not to attend\nthe Cine Gear e xpo in L .A. this y ear, since\nfeedback from man y users about the show\nwere mix ed, and our planned beta v ersion of\n3.0 is slightly dela yed.\nDevelopment and launch: Development\nis around one month behind our original\nschedule. W e expect the dela y to decrease,\nwith new de velopers on board.The launch of Drylab 3.0 will tak e place at\nthe International Broadcasters Con vention\nin Amsterdam in September , and we are\nworking hard to get solid feedback from pilot\nusers before then.\nAnnual General Meeting: Drylab 's A GM\nwill be held on June 16th at 15:00. An\ninvitation will be distributed to all owners\nwell in advance. W e hope to see y ou there!\nAs you can see it has been a hectic\nspring that has given us a lot of\nconfirmation about our product. We\nare now working eagerly and hard\ntowards the US launch with Drylab 3. 0,\nwhile keeping momentum in Europe\nwith our existing system.\n[Drylab has kindly allowed this newsletter to be redone in HTML/CSS and con verted to PDF\nwith Prince .Navngen helped anon ymize names in the process.]"
